```
Three different types of systems
Services(online systems)
Batch processing systems(offline systems)
Stream processing systems(near-real-time systems)
```

#### 1.Batch processing with Unix tools
* Simple log Analysis `Chain of commands versus custom program` `Sorting versus in-memory aggregation`
* The Unix Philosophy `A uniform interface` `Separation of logic and wiring` `Transparency and experimentation`

#### 2.MapReduce and Distributed Filesystems
* MapReduce job Execution <- Start here next time
* Reduce-side Joins and Grouping
* Map-side Joins
* The Output of Batch Workflows
* Comparing Hadoop to Distributed database

#### 3.Beyond MapReduce
* Materialization of Intermediate State
* Graphs and Iterative Processing
* High-Level APIs and Languages
